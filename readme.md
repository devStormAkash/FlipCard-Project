# 🔄 FlipCard Project | Akash Giri

Welcome to my **FlipCard Project**, a stylish web component that flips on hover to reveal hidden content — just like magic! ✨

## 💡 What It Does

When you **hover over the card**, it **flips** to show the back side. When you **move the cursor away**, it flips back to the front. Smooth, responsive, and visually clean.

- 🧍‍♂️ **Front Side**: Shows **Akash Giri’s image** along with his **academic information** 📚.
- 🌐 **Back Side**: Reveals **all of Akash's social media links** — one tap and you're connected!
